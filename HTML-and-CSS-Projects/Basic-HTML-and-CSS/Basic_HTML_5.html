		<section>
        <p>Feigning joy and surprise<br>
			At the gifts we despise over mulled wine<br>
			With you<br>
			On the 25th day<br>
			Of the 12th monthm the sleigh bells of winter<br>
			Ringing true<br>
			How we cling each Noel<br>
			To that snowflake's hope in hell<br>
			That it would end<br>
			Don't let the bells end<br>
			Christmas time<br>
			Just let them ring in peace<br>
			When the weather is cruel<br>
			And the season of Yule warms the heart<br>
			But it still hurts<br>
			You've got your career<br>
			Spend the best part of life stood apart<br>
			And it still hurts<br>
			So that's why I pray<br>
			Each and every Christmas day<br>
			That it would end<br>
			Don't let the bells end<br>
			Christmas time<br>
			Just let them ring in peace<br>
			<span style="font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">(Christmas time<br>
			Don't let the bells end<br>
			Christmas time<br>
			Don't let the bells end)</span></p>
