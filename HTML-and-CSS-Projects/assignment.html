		<h1>Castles of Wales</h1>
		
		<h3>Introduction</h3>
		
		<p>Wales is often referred to as 'The Land of Castles' due to its rich history of castle construction. It has more castles per square mile than any other European country, with over 600 castles and fortifications built during the medieval period. Many of these castles were constructed by the English monarchy to control and secure their rule over Wales following the Norman Conquest of England in 1066.</p>
