			<h3>Introduction</h3>
			
			<p>Wales is often referred to as 'The Land of Castles' due to its rich history of castle construction. It has more castles per square mile than any other European country, with over 600 castles and fortifications built during the medieval period. Many of these castles were constructed by the English monarchy to control and secure their rule over Wales following the Norman Conquest of England in 1066. From Wikipedia:</p>
		
			<blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_castles_in_Wales">Wales is sometimes called the "castle capital of the world" because of the large number of castles in a relatively small area. Wales had about 600 castles, of which over 100 are still standing, either as ruins or as restored buildings. The rest have returned to nature, and today consist of ditches, mounds, and earthworks, often in commanding positions. Many of the sites in Wales are cared for by Cadw, the Welsh government's historic environment service.

			<p>The four castles of Beaumaris, Caernarfon, Conwy, and Harlech together make up the Castles and Town Walls of King Edward in Gwynedd World Heritage Site, considered to be the "finest examples of late 13th century and early 14th century military architecture in Europe.</p>
